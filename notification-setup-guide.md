# ðŸ“± Background Push Notifications Setup Guide

## âœ… Installation Complete!
The required packages have been installed:
- `expo-notifications` - For push notifications
- `expo-device` - For device detection
- `expo-constants` - For configuration access

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Required

### 1. Update your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "TaraG",
    "slug": "tarag",
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./assets/notification-icon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "defaultChannel": "default"
        }
      ]
    ],
    "notification": {
      "icon": "./assets/notification-icon.png",
      "color": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Create Notification Icon:
- Create `assets/notification-icon.png` (96x96px)
- Should be white/transparent for best visibility
- Used for Android notification tray

### 3. Test the Implementation:

**Foreground Test (App Open on Maps):**
1. Start a route with alarm enabled
2. Approach a stop within threshold distance
3. Should see animated modal with vibration

**Background Test (App in Background):**
1. Start a route with alarm enabled
2. Navigate away from maps screen or minimize app
3. Approach a stop within threshold distance
4. Should receive push notification

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

**Smart Detection:**
- **On Maps Screen**: Shows beautiful animated modal
- **Background/Other Screens**: Sends push notification
- **App Closed**: Background location + push notification

**Distance Thresholds:**
- Walking: 50m
- Hiking: 100m  
- Biking: 100m
- Driving: 200m

**Notification Features:**
- High priority with vibration
- Shows stop name and distance
- Tapping opens app to maps screen
- Works even when app is completely closed

## ðŸ”’ Permissions:
- Location permission (already configured)
- Notification permission (auto-requested)
- Background location (configured with foreground service)

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test!
The implementation is complete and ready for testing on a physical device.
